    Product of Array Except Self
        Problem: Given an array, return an array such that each element at index i is the product of all other elements except the element at i.
        Example: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        
    Two Sum
        Problem: Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers such that they add up to the target.
        Example: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

    3Sum
        Problem: Given an array of integers, return all unique triplets that sum up to zero.
        Example: [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

    Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
        Problem: Given a string, find the longest substring with at most k distinct characters.
        Example: "eceba", k = 2

    Find All Anagrams in a String
        Problem: Given a string s and a string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
        Example: "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"

    4Sum
        Problem: Given an array of integers, find all unique quadruplets that sum up to a target number.
        Example: [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], target = 0

    Merge Sorted Array
        Problem: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.
        Example: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], [2, 5, 6]

    Subarray Sum Equals K
        Problem: Given an array of integers, find the number of contiguous subarrays whose sum equals k.
        Example: [1, 1, 1], k = 2

Hard

    Container With Most Water
        Problem: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of lines, find the two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water.
        Example: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

    Minimum Window Substring
        Problem: Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t is included in the window.
        Example: "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"

    Find the Longest Substring of Two Distinct Characters
        Problem: Find the length of the longest substring of a string containing exactly two distinct characters.
        Example: "ccaabbb", k = 2

    Longest Palindromic Substring
        Problem: Given a string, return the longest substring that is a palindrome.
        Example: "babad"

    Sliding Window Maximum
        Problem: Given an array of integers, find the maximum value in every sliding window of size k.
        Example: [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3

    Substring with Concatenation of All Words
        Problem: Given a string s and an array of strings words, find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that are a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, without any intervening characters.
        Example: "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
